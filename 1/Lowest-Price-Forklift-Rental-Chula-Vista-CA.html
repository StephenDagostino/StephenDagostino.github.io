We are one of the leading manufacturers Brick handling Pallet truck. SFS's Hand Pallet truck can also be used for carrying small non palletised loads with suitable improvisation to hold the load on the forks. Electric forklifts produce zero emissions.</p>

<p>Electric forklifts will cost more initially, but you will reap the rewards over time as they have a longer lifespan and cheaper consumption compared to other types of forklifts.
