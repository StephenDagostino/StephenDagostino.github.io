<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support. Call Andy Putnam, Rental Manager (315) 413-4150 or use the Rentals Request form to send us a Quick Request.</p>
<p>That's why our focus is making the forklift rental process quick and easy, without the usual red tape and fine print of the big rental companies. The 37-inch-wide C-G chassis—about five to six inches narrower than the chassis of a typical 4,000 to 7,000 lb. forklift—allows C-G Series forklifts to navigate tight rack storage aisles. Our stores in Sacramento, CA and throughout northern central California are fully equipped to meet your demands for rental forklifts.</p>

<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame. I'm talking about the unGodly big, oversized tires, mudflaps, etc type of trucks that look completely and utterly ridiculous. Rough terrain forklifts provide a high degree of mobility and safety as well as access to areas that would otherwise be off limits. Featuring big, tractor-style tires that provide plenty of traction to handle even the most challenging outdoor terrain, these rugged trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and used outdoors.</p>
<p>Whether you're considering a lifted truck for work, pleasure, or both, there are some important benefits to think about as you get ready to decide what your next vehicle purchase should be. Size for size, diesel forklifts that are intended for outdoor use are generally the most powerful. Weight capacity is an important detail when planning your forklift rental because you do not want to pay for a rental only to find that it cannot safely lift the loads you need to handle.</p>
