As a result, drivers will feel sleek and cool behind the wheel of some cheap used lifted trucks for sale. The SP Series 4-wheel platform stock picker is a heavy-duty stand-up lift truck used in areas where loads are bulky or extra long, such as furniture or department store warehouses.</p>
<p>We have been providing Forklift sales and services since 1986. Do not pass under the raised portion of a forklift, regardless of the presence or absence of a load. In today's business environment, you need mobility that traditional equipment procurement methods just don't offer.
