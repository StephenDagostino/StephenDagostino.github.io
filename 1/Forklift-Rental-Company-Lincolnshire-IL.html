<p>At the time, Vincent Halma, president and CEO of KION North America, said the rate at which we're releasing new products and services is truly unprecedented.” KION also recently announced plans to expand its South Carolina facility capacity to 12,000 lift trucks a year by 2020, up from 3,000 in 2015.

Also called a pump truck, a pallet jack is smaller in size than the above mentioned forklifts.</p>

Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>
