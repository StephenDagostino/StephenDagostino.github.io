If the employee was hired: The initial training and evaluation of that employee must be completed: Before December 1, 1999 By December 1, 1999 After December 1, 1999 Before the employee is assigned to operate a powered industrial truck.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>

<p>In a bizarre incident captured on surveillance cameras, strong winds lifted a truck off the ground and flipped it around on its front wheel before slamming it back on the road. Truck drivers from the Richardson and Garland regions won't believe the lifted trucks and 4x4 conversion trucks on sale right now at Young Chevrolet in Dallas.
