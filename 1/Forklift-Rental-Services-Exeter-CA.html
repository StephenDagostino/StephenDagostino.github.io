<p>State plans are OSHA-approved job safety and health programs operated by individual states instead of federal OSHA. One of the most popular adjustments to trucks is the lift kit - moving the entire truck higher in the air by changing out suspension parts. About 92% of these are forklifts, 1% are material handling equipment parts. This purchasing guide will examine the specific features that qualify the machines to be considered 'rough terrain'.</p>
<p>However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up. In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
<p>Beyond the size and power source, when choosing a forklift you need to evaluate a variety of factors that impact your long-term cost, including how much and how high the machine can lift, how careful you need to be when manipulating the load in sensitive areas and whether you should buy or rent a forklift. The Multi-Task Control Handle allows operators to manage travel direction and speed while maneuvering during lift and reach operations.</p>
