<p>United Rentals was founded in 1997 and is the largest equipment rental company in the world. Items such as computers, drums, corrugated boxes, plastic bottles, furniture and beverages are examples of products which are stacked onto pallets and moved by reach trucks. Crown also introduced a number of technology enhancements to improve forklift safety. At ProMat 2019 in booth #S3603, attendees can view the brand-new Yale® robotic reach truck, an industry-first dual-mode pantograph robotic lift truck capable of autonomously depositing and retrieving loads from locations as high as 30 feet and reaching into double-deep storage.</p>

They offer a streamlined credit approval process so you can rent forklifts (and other equipment, if needed) without paying the full price up front.</p>

<p>The hand pallet or lift truck has wheels located under the fork and uses a hydraulic jack for lifting and moving the pallets.
