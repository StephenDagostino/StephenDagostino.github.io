<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. Not move the truck and remain at the controls at all times, if operating an industrial lift truck with a forklift platform with an employee on the platform. For trucks with tilting forks, the forks shall be horizontal or at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable. If you work in a job that requires you to use a forklift primarily outdoors on natural or uneven terrain, even occasionally or rarely, you need rough terrain forklift training.</p>
<p>Never use a diesel engine, internal combustion gas, or propane powered lift truck models in confined spaces for long periods of time. Yet large trucks can't be raised and driven safely until their brakes are modified. Conform with manufacturers requirements as per the operators handbook, other types of information source and relevant regulations and legislation.</p>

The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.
