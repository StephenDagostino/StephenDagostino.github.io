<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>
<p>However, when you purchase a used forklift, operators will already be familiar with the forklift operations and can easily take over the job. We are offering Manual Pallet Truck to our client and our product is made of good quality.
