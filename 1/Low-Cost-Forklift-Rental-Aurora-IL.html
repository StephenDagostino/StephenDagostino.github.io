<p>Many rough terrain forklifts come with either two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive options.

We carry a huge selection of lift trucks and forklifts for rent to provide a fit no matter the size or scope of your application. Now you've seen how a forklift's center of gravity can shift. So, the operator can drive straight in the aisle and turn the mast at a 90-degree angle to access the material.</p>

For nearly 50 years, customers have relied on the Cat lift trucks brand for quality and reliable forklifts backed by exceptional service and support through its trusted dealer network. If your company has a forklift that's dead in the water, ForkliftTrader does on-site service calls.</p>
<p>Even among lift kits, there are smaller options that just level out the truck from the common nose down” factory settings and others that will make your truck tall enough to walk under. Browse Order Picker Truck Equipment. The Mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets weighing 3,000 - 6,000lbs.</p>
