<h2>Buying A Used Forklift Cheshire </h2>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>

No matter what size or capacity you need, you can find a rough terrain forklift for the job. Models through 16,000 pounds lift capacity use a standard 100-horsepower engine; the next two larger models use a 142-horsepower engine; and the largest model, the LK30P44, has a 225-horsepower engine.</p>
<p>Included in each TowPro Air Kit from Ridetech will be 2 Rear exact-fit shock absorbers. High-lift rider trucks shall be fitted with an overhead guard unless the customer otherwise requests. This is important because Ahern has one of the broadest selections of forklifts available on the market. What's unique about this type of forklift is that the mast can turn left or right independent of the body of the truck.</p>
