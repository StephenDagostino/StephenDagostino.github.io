Depending on its capabilities and features, a new reach forklift might cost approximately $15,000 to $35,000 and up. We are exporter and has created a benchmark in the industry as a trusted manufacturer of hand pallet truck wheels. Regardless of the brand name, you should expect to find an engine capable of at least 74 to 78 hp on the lower end (straight mast forklifts) and up to 142 hp on the high end (encompassing telehandlers with extended reach capability).</p>
<p>You must know how to safely load, unload, and drive a rough terrain forklift to prevent accidents and injuries.

While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts.
