<p>SCA Performance RAM trucks are some of the most powerful and performance-ready lifted trucks in the industry. This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life.

A brief discussion of the various types of forklifts on the market can help you to understand why answering the above questions first is essential to ensure you get the right equipment for the job.</p>
<p>Toyota forklifts stand out from the competition in one category. The term fork lift refers to a variety of motor-powered trucks equipped with lifting forks that are used for loading, unloading, and organizing materials that are stacked on pallets or designed for lifting with forks. This type of rough terrain forklift is vehicle-mounted and fitted with a telescopic boom lift, which allows this machine to pick up and transport loads at various distances and heights.</p>

The company builds 350,000 trucks each year, and their lowest lift weight is only 1,500 lbs while their heavy duty units can lift 100,000 lbs. Whether you're searching for your first lift truck, replacing a piece of equipment or expanding your fleet, we hope this breakdown of the various forklift classifications is helpful as you focus on finding the ideal type of forklift or materials handling equipment for your company.</p>
