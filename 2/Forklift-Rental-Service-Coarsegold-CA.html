<p>BVA offers a wide range of industrial products to suit any industry including construction, mining, oil, forestry, foundation repair, MRO, OEMs and more. The dashboards of forklifts today use computers. Our rental lift trucks are maintained to the industry's highest standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations. Before choosing a standup forklift, it's important to determine the size of the typical load that you will be lifting. Contact BigRentz at (888) 325-5172 to find the right rough terrain forklift for your job site.</p>
<p>Because extreme bounce can be a common problem in lifted trucks, we suggest continuously monitoring the bounce of your lifted truck. Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism. However, you will need basic numeracy skills and to be able to speak, read and write in English well enough to do the training and forklift driving licence test explained above.</p>

Depending on the quality of your shocks, you'll likely enjoy more control of your vehicle and higher ground clearance as well.
