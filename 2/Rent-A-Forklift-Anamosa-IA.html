<p>At Thompson Machinery, we've invested in a fleet of Cat forklifts, so you don't have to. Simply let us know when you need your forklift and for how long. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see.

<p>However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up. In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>

<h3>Importance of Forklift Training in Anamosa IA 52205</h3>
<p>Caterpillar forklifts are notoriously powerful. A parking brake (or mechanism) which may be a part of, or include the service brake(s), shall be provided and be capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 10% grade, whichever is the lesser. The innovative 3-phase motors in our electric forklifts combine powerful performance with minimal consumption of power.</p>
<p>Forklift rental also helps manage capital expenditure. In a crash with a lifted car, this show of force can become a terrifying reality. Besides, forklift training offers the operator the latest maneuvering and handling skills needed to increase efficiency. We are the industry leading materials handling company across Bristol, Swindon , Cheltenham , Gloucester , Stroud, Bath and Weston Super-Mare, providing bespoke solutions to a wide array of clients across a multitude of sectors.</p>
