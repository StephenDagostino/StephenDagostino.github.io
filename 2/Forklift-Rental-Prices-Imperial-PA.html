<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck — any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course. We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

Fork lifts are often used to unload materials from trucks, ships, and other large containers used in shipping and distribution.</p>

Whether the driver will be using the vehicle for rock climbing, regular road travel, racing, or for use in sandy or water-filled areas, will determine the type of tires that need to be put on the truck.</p>
