Layman's Terms: Off-roading is fun, until you have to be towed 30 miles to a shop when your driveshaft falls out because you just had to have the huge lift. If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over. As time has passed, forklifts have tended to specialization.</p>
<p>You will commonly see these lift trucks used at construction sites to transport and lift building materials. Lift and tow heavy or extremely large loads efficiently and safely in rough terrain environments with power and precision. Suitable for heavy-duty applications, our multidirectional reach truck is capable of handling both conventional pallets and long loads, such as steel beams and plastic pipes.</p>

<p>Often one or more of these three types of reach trucks are used in warehouses. The result is a smarter, more scalable fleet of reach trucks. For 4-wheel internal combustion forklifts, options and accessories include mini-lever controls with an armrest that can be adjusted in three ways, an LPG swing-down bracket which can lower the bracket 65 degrees from the horizontal position, and a steering wheel knob that can make driving the lift more efficient.</p>

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable.
