<p>If your company has an old forklift on its way out, get in touch. Counterbalance forklifts are one of the most popular types of powered industrial trucks used today, and the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) requires counterbalance forklift training for any operator using this type of lift. If you need help choosing a suspension kit for your vehicle, or can't find the kit your looking for, contact one of our mechanics.</p>
<p>A pallet jack that is too long will make it difficult to maneuver around your warehouse, and one that is too short may not fully support the load and become an unstable safety risk. Robotic technology is estimated to be used across the Class III Forklift Trucks over the forecast period. If you plan to use a rough terrain forklift in a confined space, dimensions are important.</p>
<p>Forklift on hire you can find on heavy equipments. Other forklifts raise the operator with the forks, or are operated from a standing position. Ahern Rentals has over 40,000 pieces of equipment and vehicles available for rent across the US. A work platform of at least 20 inches wide must be securely attached to the lifting carriage or forks. Standard counterbalance forklifts require aisles of approximately 13 ft wide to effectively turn, navigate, and move pallets.</p>

If you've never rented before, you might be surprised at the actual forklift rental cost and how affordable it can be. However, statistics show that companies that own their fleets tend to keep their forklifts longer than financially makes sense.</p>

<p>We also operate three trucks for parts collection in Johannesburg and share the use of a warehouse facility in Jet Park for these conditions.
