It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead.

They offer straight forward operation and have dual forks at the front of the truck to lift and transport loads.</p>
