<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support. Call Andy Putnam, Rental Manager (315) 413-4150 or use the Rentals Request form to send us a Quick Request.</p>

<h2>Forklift Rules Of The Road Fremont </h2>
<p>By raising the truck's chassis, more room is provided for large size tires and wheels. Long Term Forklift Rental enables you to work with a minimal amount of equipment reducing the need for spare or surplus equipment. Rental provides the means to obtain the latest technology improving operator satisfaction, WH&S and overall efficiencies.

The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.
