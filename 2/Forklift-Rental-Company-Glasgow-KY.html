Unfortunately, not every company has the budget to purchase brand-new forklifts. Our range of Rough Terrain Pallet Truck is scientifically designed to achieve maximum production capacity with minimum human efforts. Built on RICO's many years of lift truck experience, the Pegasus Series trucks are designed for demanding applications that require clean, quiet-running, heavy-duty capabilities.</p>
<p>A rental can also serve as a test drive,” allowing you to test out different types of equipment to determine what you want to purchase. These permit the truck to drive over bumpy terrain without harming the vehicle's under-body. This abrasion can reduce the thickness of a fork until it cannot lift loads up to the designed capacity. Apart from this, a feedback of the spec sheet for Jungheinrich's 5000 lb. Electric counterbalanced truck shows that it has actually eclipsed the performance specifications of most internal combustion trucks.</p>

<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up.
